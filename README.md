# Air Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses advanced machine learning algorithms to predict air quality levels based on environmental data such as pollutant concentrations, weather conditions, and other key indicators. It supports both regression (predicting AQI value) and classification (predicting AQI category) models.

## Overview

The objective is to develop a predictive model that forecasts air quality levels using various features such as:
- PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, O3, SO2
- Weather parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed)
- AQI or AQI Category
